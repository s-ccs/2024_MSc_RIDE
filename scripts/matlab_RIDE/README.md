# Matlab Ride Project

This project contains the orginal matlab RIDE implementation with some scripts that were used during the development of UnfoldRIDE. There are scripts to:
- "run_import_simulated.m"      import and run simulated data + benchmark       
- "run_matlab_sample.m"         run the real dataset included in the matlab version + benchmark
- "export_results.m"            export algorithm results using hdf5 for plotting in julia
- "export_sample_data.m"        export sample data using hdf5 for use in UnfoldRIDE
- "data_filepath.m"             set the data directory for imports and exports
